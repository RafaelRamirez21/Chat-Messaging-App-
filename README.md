## Reflection
This was a great collaborative project that was made with love. Throughtout this project we improved our skills in the both side, backend and frontend and strengthen the teamwork skill.
I started this process by using my webpack configuration where adding `react-router-` and `stream-chat-react`and `react-icon`.
